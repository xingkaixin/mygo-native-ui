# mygo-native-ui

Native UI components for [mygo](https://github.com/egoist/mygo), built only on its public `ui` API.

```sh
go get github.com/xingkaixin/mygo-native-ui
```

Requires mygo v0.5.5 and Go 1.27.1 or later.

## Components

| Package | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| [`ui/gif`](ui/gif) | Plays animated GIFs: frame offsets, transparency, disposal methods and loop counts. Shows the first frame when the desktop asks for less motion. | [`examples/gif`](examples/gif) |
| [`ui/tabs`](ui/tabs) | Document tab bar, as in editors: close buttons, middle-click to close, a modified dot, drag to reorder, and horizontal scrolling when the tabs overflow. | [`examples/tabs`](examples/tabs) |
| [`ui/chartx`](ui/chartx) | Extensions to mygo's `ui/chart`: a logarithmic scale, a legend that shows and hides series, zooming and panning along x, heatmaps with a sequential color scale, histogram bins, a GitHub-style contribution calendar, and sparklines. | [`examples/chartx`](examples/chartx), [`examples/dashboard`](examples/dashboard) |
| [`ui/shortcut`](ui/shortcut) | Keyboard shortcut recorder field, key caps, parsing to and from accelerator strings such as `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+K`, and menu text such as `⇧⌘K`. | [`examples/shortcut`](examples/shortcut) |
| [`ui/palette`](ui/palette) | Command palette: fuzzy matching with highlighted matches, sections, shortcuts by each command, and keyboard navigation. | [`examples/palette`](examples/palette) |
| [`ui/zoomview`](ui/zoomview) | Zoomable, pannable view of any content: fit, actual size, zooming around the pointer, dragging and keyboard shortcuts. | [`examples/zoomview`](examples/zoomview) |
| [`ui/logview`](ui/logview) | Streaming log view: ANSI colors and styles, carriage-return progress lines, a line limit, filtering, and following the end. | [`examples/logview`](examples/logview) |
| [`ui/hexview`](ui/hexview) | Hex dump with an ASCII column, linked selection by mouse and keyboard, and copying as hex or text. | [`examples/hexview`](examples/hexview) |
| [`ui/jsonview`](ui/jsonview) | JSON tree that keeps member order, colors values by type, shows JSONPath of the chosen row, and copies values and paths. | [`examples/jsonview`](examples/jsonview) |
| [`ui/columns`](ui/columns) | Finder's column view: a list for each level of a tree, keyboard navigation between columns, and a preview of the chosen leaf. | [`examples/columns`](examples/columns) |
| [`ui/inspector`](ui/inspector) | Inspector panel parts: collapsible sections, labeled rows, and number fields that scrub by dragging their label and step with the arrow keys. | [`examples/inspector`](examples/inspector) |
| [`ui/kvtable`](ui/kvtable) | Key-value table editor, as for query parameters and headers: rows that turn on and off, a draft row that adds rows as you type, and removing rows. | [`examples/kvtable`](examples/kvtable) |
| [`ui/kanban`](ui/kanban) | Kanban board: cards dragged within and between lanes, with a drop indicator, and chosen and moved with the keyboard. | [`examples/kanban`](examples/kanban) |
| [`ui/settings`](ui/settings) | System Settings layout: rows in rounded groups with labels on the left and controls on the right, switches, rows linking to other panes, and notes. | [`examples/settings`](examples/settings) |
| [`ui/waveform`](ui/waveform) | Audio waveform from precomputed peaks: playhead, selecting a stretch, zooming around the pointer, panning, and following the playhead. | [`examples/waveform`](examples/waveform) |
| [`ui/thumbgrid`](ui/thumbgrid) | Thumbnail grid that loads only what shows: pictures decoded and shrunk in the background, the latest asked for first, and kept in a cache. | [`examples/thumbgrid`](examples/thumbgrid) |
| [`ui/emoji`](ui/emoji) | Emoji picker: search by name, group tabs, frequently used emoji, and a preview of the emoji under the pointer. Embeds Unicode's emoji data ([license](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt)). | [`examples/emoji`](examples/emoji) |
| [`ui/weekview`](ui/weekview) | Calendar week view: overlapping events side by side, dragged to another time or day and stretched by their bottom edge in 15-minute steps, and a line at the time now. | [`examples/weekview`](examples/weekview) |

### Menu bar

| Package | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|
| [`ui/trayicon`](ui/trayicon) | Renders native UI into tray icon PNGs, transparent and at 2×, such as a live bar chart. | [`examples/menubar`](examples/menubar) |
| [`ui/menupanel`](ui/menupanel) | Menus inside menu bar panels: checks, shortcuts, details, disabled items, submenus that open in place, and keyboard navigation. | [`examples/menubar`](examples/menubar) |
| [`ui/tiles`](ui/tiles) | Control Center tiles: toggles with an icon and status, and wide sliders. | [`examples/menubar`](examples/menubar) |
